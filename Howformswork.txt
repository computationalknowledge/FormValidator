Form is an HTML Element

Form is the way we send information to the SERVER

A form has the following elements:

INPUTS: text, radio, checkboxes, text fields, and text areas

SUBMIT BUTTON: when submit button is pressed, the browser sends all the information
contained in the fields as input the program on the server which is spe specified in the ACTION ATTRIBUTE of the form

The program on the server runs taking the provided client browser form data as input, and transmits it to the server.

The web browser wraps up all the field data into either a POST or GET request, and sends that package of data to the server on the HTTP
PIPE that is connecting the web browser and the server.
